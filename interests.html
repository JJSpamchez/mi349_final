            Nothing else could top a list of my interests. Arcane is the most beautifully crafted piece of media I've ever seen. I say that without hyperbole. To me, Arcane is better 
than any movie, show, or song that I've ever experienced. It is truly that good. For the sake of being concise, I won't go crazy in detail of all of the ways this show blows me away, 
but if anyone knows me in real life, they know that I desperately want them to watch Arcane. <br><br><br> Take whatever you know about League of Legends and throw it out the window. 
There is no such thing. There's no insanely complex video game with one of the most deranged and toxic playerbases on the planet. It's just these incredible characters and this beautifully realized world. 
As someone who knew the lore of the video game versions of these characters, knowing that lore neither harms nor helps the viewing experience. The show is that. good. It takes characters that have 
established identities and traits and builds them naturally from the ground up. The journey of the story is insane as well. I watched one of those corny YouTube videos that shows each character's 
first scene in season one and then their final scene in the series finale, and I was genuinely floored by just how big of a leap most of these stories within Arcane took. Watch Arcane. Please. Thank me after your fourth or fifth rewatch.

            Mentioning League of Legends leads directly into another, more obvious interest; "Hey, Games & Interactive Media student! What's your favorite video game?" Easy. No thought, no hesitation, Super Mario Galaxy. 
This game is one of the most perfect blends of nostalgia and genuine quality to me. I loved it as a kid, and I keep coming back to play it when I can (it's basically the only reason I brought my Wii to my apartment with me. 
One of the most well thought out and designed platformers ever made. Galaxy consistently innovates with every new idea, and I would gladly play sequel after sequel (Galaxy 2 is really good, but this one has more defined and solidified ideas). 
<br><br><br> Recently, Super Mario Galaxy released on the Nintendo Switch in a bundle containing itself, Super Mario 64, and Super Mario Sunshine. To this day, this bundle remains one of my happiest game purchases. 
It was only available to buy for a limited time, and being able to play Galaxy on the go with control sticks was a blessing I didn't know I needed (the classic controls and feeling of the Wii can't be beat, no matter how well they brought it to the Switch).
