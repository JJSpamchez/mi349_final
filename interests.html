            Nothing else could top a list of my interests. Arcane is the most beautifully crafted piece of media I've ever seen. I say that without hyperbole. To me, Arcane is better 
than any movie, show, or song that I've ever experienced. It is truly that good. For the sake of being concise, I won't go crazy in detail of all of the ways this show blows me away, 
but if anyone knows me in real life, they know that I desperately want them to watch Arcane. <br><br><br> Take whatever you know about League of Legends and throw it out the window. 
There is no such thing. There's no insanely complex video game with one of the most deranged and toxic playerbases on the planet. It's just these incredible characters and this beautifully realized world. 
As someone who knew the lore of the video game versions of these characters, knowing that lore neither harms nor helps the viewing experience. The show is that. good. It takes characters that have 
established identities and traits and builds them naturally from the ground up. The journey of the story is insane as well. I watched one of those corny YouTube videos that shows each character's 
first scene in season one and then their final scene in the series finale, and I was genuinely floored by just how big of a leap most of these stories within Arcane took. Watch Arcane. Please. Thank me after your fourth or fifth rewatch.
