            I'm a Senior at MSU with a passion for the arts, my favorites being music and games. 
                Find out more about my background, my projects, and what inspires me! I grew up in Grand Ledge, Michigan and was basically born to be a Spartan, as both my parents got their 
degrees from here. I'm a fourth year Games & Interactive Media major, and I'm making it one day at a time. This semester was pretty stressful (which seems to be a theme I've found within most semesters), but 
I'm satisfied with the quality of work that I've done (both in this class and outside of it) and am looking forward to a relaxing winter break.
<br> The picture to the left is of me and Tom Izzo! I got the opportunity to briefly speak with Izzo at an event with the RSO that I am the president of, The MSU Accafellas.
The Fellas have been a big source of support and leisure this semester and throughout college. Most of my close friends are from Fellas, and I'm almost always hanging out with one or some of them outside of 
school, work, and rehearsal.
